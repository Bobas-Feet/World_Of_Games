# World Of Games
Python project for DevOps course

In this project I will let the player choose between several short games, written in python, and allow for bi-lingual play (English/Hebrew).

Choose one of the following games to test your skills:

1. Memory Game - A sequence of numbers will appear for 1 second and you have to
guess it back.

2. Guess Game - Guess the number to see if you chose like the computer.

3. Currency Roulette Game - Try and guess the value of a random amount of USD in ILS.
