Python project for DevOps course


World Of Games

In this project I will let the player choose between several short games, written in python, and allow for bi-lingual play (English/Hebrew).

1. Memory Game - A sequence of numbers will appear for 1 second and you have to
guess it back.

2. Guess Game - Guess the number to see if you chose like the computer.

3. Currency Roulette - Try and guess the value of a random amount of USD in ILS.
